# Nginx Cloud Run Deployment Fix Summary

## Problem
The Cloud Run deployment was failing with the error:
```
The user-provided container failed to start and listen on the port defined provided by the PORT=8080 environment variable within the allocated timeout.
```

## Root Cause Analysis

After examining the configuration files, I identified the following issues:

1. **Default nginx configuration conflict**: The nginx:1.25-alpine base image comes with a default configuration that could conflict with our custom configuration
2. **No build-time validation**: There was no check to ensure the nginx configuration was valid before the container was deployed
3. **Basic nginx configuration**: The nginx.conf lacked important optimizations and health checks needed for Cloud Run

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Dockerfile Changes

#### Added: Remove default nginx configuration
```dockerfile
# Remove the default nginx configuration
RUN rm /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
```
**Rationale**: Prevents conflicts between the default nginx configuration and our custom configuration.

#### Added: Nginx configuration test
```dockerfile
# Test nginx configuration before starting
RUN nginx -t
```
**Rationale**: Catches configuration errors at build time rather than at runtime, making debugging much easier.

### 2. nginx.conf Enhancements

#### Added: Server name directive
```nginx
server_name _;
```
**Rationale**: Explicitly sets the server name to match any host, which is a best practice.

#### Added: Gzip compression
```nginx
gzip on;
gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript;
gzip_min_length 256;
```
**Rationale**: Reduces bandwidth usage and improves load times for users.

#### Improved: SPA routing
```nginx
try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
```
**Rationale**: Better fallback handling for single-page applications, checking for both files and directories.

#### Added: Static asset caching with font support
```nginx
location ~* \.(?:css|js|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|svg|woff|woff2|ttf|eot)$ {
  expires 1y;
  add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=31536000, immutable";
  access_log off;
}
```
**Rationale**: Improves performance by caching static assets for 1 year and disables access logging for these files.

#### Added: HTML file no-cache policy
```nginx
location ~* \.html$ {
  expires -1;
  add_header Cache-Control "no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, proxy-revalidate, max-age=0";
}
```
**Rationale**: Ensures users always get the latest HTML, which is important for SPAs where the HTML might contain new bundle references.

#### Added: Health check endpoint
```nginx
location /health {
  access_log off;
  return 200 "healthy\n";
  add_header Content-Type text/plain;
}
```
**Rationale**: Provides a dedicated health check endpoint for Cloud Run to verify the service is running. This can be accessed at `https://your-service-url/health`.

**Suggested PR Title:**

Fix: Nginx configuration for Cloud Run deployment
```

**Suggested PR Description:**

## Problem
The Cloud Run deployment was failing with the error: "The user-provided container failed to start and listen on the port defined provided by the PORT=8080 environment variable within the allocated timeout."

## Root Cause
The nginx configuration was not being properly set up in the Docker container, potentially conflicting with the default nginx configuration files that come with the nginx:1.25-alpine base image.

## Solution

### Dockerfile Changes
1. **Remove default nginx config**: Added a step to explicitly remove the default nginx configuration file before copying our custom one to prevent conflicts
2. **Add configuration test**: Added `nginx -t` command to test the configuration during build time, ensuring any configuration errors are caught before deployment

### nginx.conf Enhancements
1. **Added gzip compression**: Improved performance by enabling compression for text-based files
2. **Better caching strategy**: 
   - Static assets (CSS, JS, images, fonts) are cached for 1 year
   - HTML files are set to never cache to ensure fresh content
3. **Health check endpoint**: Added `/health` endpoint for Cloud Run health checks
4. **Improved SPA routing**: Enhanced the try_files directive to better handle single-page application routing

## Testing
- Nginx configuration is tested during Docker build (`nginx -t`)
- Configuration follows Cloud Run best practices
- Health check endpoint available at `/health`

## Expected Outcome
The container should now:
1. Start successfully
2. Listen on port 8080 as required by Cloud Run
3. Serve the React application correctly
4. Handle SPA routing properly
5. Provide better performance with gzip compression and caching
```

### 2. Merge the PR

Once the PR is reviewed and approved, merge it to the main branch.

### 3. Verify Deployment

After merging:
1. Cloud Build will automatically trigger (assuming the trigger is set up for the main branch)
2. The new container will be built with the fixes
3. Cloud Run will deploy the new version
4. Verify the deployment is successful by:
   - Visiting the Cloud Run service URL
   - Checking the `/health` endpoint
   - Testing the resume app functionality

## Expected Results

✅ **Container should start successfully**
✅ **Nginx should listen on port 8080**
✅ **Application should be accessible**
✅ **Health check endpoint should respond with "healthy"**
✅ **Static assets should be properly cached**
✅ **Gzip compression should reduce bandwidth usage**

## Verification Commands

After deployment, you can verify the fixes worked:

```bash
# Check if the service is running
gcloud run services describe resume-app --region=us-east1 --format="value(status.url)"

# Test the health endpoint
curl https://your-service-url/health

# Check response headers for gzip
curl -I -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" https://your-service-url/

# Check static asset caching
curl -I https://your-service-url/assets/index-[hash].css
```

## Troubleshooting

If the deployment still fails:

1. **Check Cloud Build logs**:
   ```bash
   gcloud builds list --limit=5
   gcloud builds log [BUILD_ID]
   ```

2. **Check Cloud Run logs**:
   ```bash
   gcloud run services logs read resume-app --region=us-east1 --limit=50
   ```

3. **Verify the build succeeds locally** (requires Docker):
   ```bash
   cd /home/ubuntu/github_repos/resume-app
   docker build --build-arg API_KEY=test_key -t resume-app:test .
   docker run -p 8080:8080 resume-app:test
   # Visit http://localhost:8080 to test
   ```
