# AI Resume Formatter - Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values
# DO NOT commit the .env file with real credentials to version control

# ============================================
# Gemini API Configuration
# ============================================

# Google Gemini API Key for AI-powered resume processing
# Get your API key from: https://aistudio.google.com/
# 
# For local development, use VITE_API_KEY (Vite will expose it to the client)
# Format: AIza... (Google API keys start with "AIza")
VITE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Alternative variable name for production builds
# This is used during Docker builds via --build-arg
# API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# ============================================
# Security Notes
# ============================================
# 
# ⚠️ IMPORTANT SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
# 
# 1. This API key is embedded in the client-side JavaScript bundle and is 
#    visible to anyone who inspects your application.
# 
# 2. ALWAYS restrict your API key in Google Cloud Console:
#    - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
#    - Set "Application restrictions" to "HTTP referrers"
#    - Add your domain(s): 
#      * https://your-app.run.app/*
#      * http://localhost:*/* (for local development)
#    - Set "API restrictions" to only allow "Generative Language API"
# 
# 3. Set usage quotas to prevent abuse:
#    - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/generativelanguage.googleapis.com/quotas
# 
# 4. For production deployments:
#    - Use Cloud Build substitution variables (see cloudbuild.yaml)
#    - Never commit real API keys to version control
#    - Consider using Google Secret Manager for enhanced security
# 
# 5. If you accidentally commit a secret:
#    - Immediately revoke/delete the API key in Google Cloud Console
#    - Generate a new API key
#    - Follow the instructions in SECURITY.md to clean git history
# 
# ============================================
# Development vs Production
# ============================================
# 
# LOCAL DEVELOPMENT (npm run dev):
# - Uses VITE_API_KEY from this .env file
# - Vite automatically loads .env files
# 
# PRODUCTION BUILD (Docker/Cloud Run):
# - Uses API_KEY passed as Docker build argument
# - Set in Cloud Build trigger substitution variables
# - See README.md and DEPLOYMENT.md for details
